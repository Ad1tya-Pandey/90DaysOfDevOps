# Task for day 14

1).   
A list is a collection of items in a specific order. Lists are enclosed in square brackets [ ] and items are separated by commas. They are mutable, meaning you can add, remove or change items in a list.

A tuple is similar to a list, but it is enclosed in parentheses ( ) and items are also separated by commas. Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot add, remove or change items once they are created.

A set is a collection of unique items. Sets are enclosed in curly braces { } and items are separated by commas. Sets do not have a specific order and cannot have duplicate items.
