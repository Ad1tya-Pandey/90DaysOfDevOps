# Task -  day 44

## Using RDS 

- here , in this task i have created a RDS of mysql community version and attached it through a ec2 instance which i attached to it after being recommended by the service page itself.
- This task depicts a real life scenario where a server is connected to database only and they both reside in the same VPC and no other entity from the internet other than that particular instance can access the database. This is good for security practices.

### Screenshots:
- RDS (SQL)
